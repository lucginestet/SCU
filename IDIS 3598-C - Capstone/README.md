# Capstone

Every public company must submit reports to the Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC). A company’s flagship annual report, Form 10-K, is made available to the public on the SEC’s EDGAR website. Included in the 10-K document is a management disclosure that discusses potential risk factors to the company including potential health crises. The goal of our capstone project is to understand how management disclosures in 10-K documents might be useful to shareholders and stakeholders of a company. We are interested in seeing how managers discussed pandemic-related risk factors prior to COVID-19 and if the extent to which they discussed risk factors is associated with stock performance after the pandemic. We will compare companies that did disclose pre-pandemic to those that didn’t disclose and see if those companies that did disclose performed better. We will also be comparing by industry to see which industries increased their disclosure and how it affected each industry's performance. To measure performance we will analyze the average Sharpe Ratio change from before the pandemic to after the pandemic by industry and compare the differences between the companies that did disclose and didn’t disclose in each industry. We will also examine whether companies that did disclose had higher alpha, risk adjusted excess return, than companies that did not.
