# Introduction to Time Series Forecasting

This project studies residential power usage in Houston Texas, analyzing time series data
between June 2016 and August 2020. This report is tailored towards power grid suppliers
where forecasts of power usage can allow suppliers to anticipate and meet consumer
demand and properly apply surge pricing.
We choose this topic because of the blackouts that Texas experienced due to improper
energy grid management. We want to build a forecasting model to help power suppliers
anticipate power usage and adapt for the future.
